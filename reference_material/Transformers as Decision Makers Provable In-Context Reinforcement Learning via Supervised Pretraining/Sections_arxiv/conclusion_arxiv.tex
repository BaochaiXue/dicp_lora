\section{Conclusions}

This paper theoretically investigates the ICRL capability of supervised-pretrained transformers. We demonstrate how transformers can efficiently implement prevalent RL algorithms including LinUCB, Thompson sampling, and UCB-VI, achieving near-optimal regrets in respective settings. We also provide sample complexity guarantees for the supervised pretraining approach to learning these algorithms. The generalization error scales with the covering number of the transformer class as well as the distribution ratio between the expert and offline algorithms. Simulations validate our theoretical findings.
Finally, we discuss the limitations of our results and provide additional discussions in Appendix~\ref{sec:limitation}.
